After our first meetup where we met almost everybody who expressed interest in our community, we are going to meet again to compose a list of topics that every attendee is interested.
<!--more-->

Join us for our second meetup as we gather once again to shape the future discussions of our growing tech community. Building upon the success of our inaugural gathering where we connected with nearly everyone interested in our community, we're excited to delve deeper into the topics that pique your interest.

We aim to compile a list of subjects that resonate with each attendee, whether it's something you're eager to share your expertise on or a topic you're keen to explore further with fellow enthusiasts. Whether you're a seasoned professional looking to impart knowledge in future meetups or simply interested in absorbing insights from others, you're welcome to join us â€“ there's no pressure to commit.

Not sure what topics to suggest? No problem! Your presence alone adds value to our discussions. Feel free to drop by, say hi, and share your thoughts or suggestions. We're all about fostering an inclusive environment where every voice matters.

Looking forward to seeing you there!

# How we organize events

## Talks

1. We receive proposals for talks. We can host 1 or 2 talks per meetup depending of their length and the number of proposal that we have received.
2. We look for dates for the talks coordinating the spaces that we can dispose for the meetup and the speakers' availability.
3. We set a date and we publish the event form where people can join to the meetup
4. We spread the meetup in all the mediums that we can
